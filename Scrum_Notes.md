# Scrum Notes

    Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.

## Empirical Process Control Three Pillars

### Transparency
-	Language of outcomes understandable by all participants
-	Common definition of “Done”

### Inspection
-	Frequently inspect scrum artifact without overly effecting the work

### Adaptation
-	If inspection determines that a process will result in a product that is unacceptable it is paramount to change early to minimize further deviation.

### Four formal Inspection & Adaptation events

#### Sprint Planning
    -   What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint? 
    -   How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

#### Daily Scrum
    -   What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? 
    -   What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? 
    -   Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

#### Sprint Review
    -   Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;
    -   The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”; 
    -   The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved; 
    -   The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment; 
    -   The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on progress to date (if needed); 
    -   The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning; 
    -   Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next; and, 
    -   Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product.
    * Introduce Sprint Goal
    * Story of Sprint
    * Feature Demonstration
    * Outline Potential Priorities for next sprint
    * Include summary and detailed wireframes
    * Key Learnings / Takeaways and Questions

#### Sprint Retrospective
    -   Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
    -   Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
    -   Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.
    *   What could have been done better?
    *   What did we do well?
    *   Definition of Done
    *   Improvement Goals

#### Definition of Done Example
    -   New features consider mobile platforms
    -   All worked on features and behaviors fully documented in stories or tasks.
    -   Code follows PSR-2 standards for commenting
    -   Code passes PSR-2 linting tests
    -   All code submitted as a pull request and reviewed by a second scrum team member
    -   Improvements from code review implemented or considered
    -   Automated Unit Tests Passing
    -   Behavior Tests Passing
    -   Acceptance Tests and any blocking QA tasks have been completed
    -   Integration tests passed and verified
    -   Story and any related sub-tasks moved to status of "Done"
    -   Done confirmed by Product Owner

#### The Scrum Team
    -   Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.
    -   Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team
    -   They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;

#### Monitoring Progress towards a Goal
    -   Burndowns
    -   burn-ups
    -   cumulative flows
