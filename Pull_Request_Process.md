# Pull Request Process Document 

- Always work from a well-defined story/issue
    - A story should never have a blank description
    - Add a technical design before coding and have it reviewed by a peer.
- Review the [Git Process Document](./Git_Process.md) for git usage and recommendations.
- Create your branch right off the development branch
    - Review Git Usage
- Keep your PRs small
    - Breakdown big stories into smaller pieces and add a separate PR for each. 
- Rebase your branch against development daily to minimize the complexities involved in rebasing against too many merge conflicts.
- Pull requests should only contain code modifications related to the problem at hand without adding any unnecessary scope.
- Commit early, often, and in isolation - do not mix code changes with separate intents into one commit
    - commits should be broken up into logical commits as much as possible.
    - Leave a blank line between the first and the second lines of a multiline commit message
    - Review the DIFF for each file before you commit it
        - Discard lines that were changed that shouldnâ€™t be part of this commit
    - We run the following hooks before commits, DO NOT skip
        - Frontend (lint-styled & husky)
            - eslint
            - prettier
            - jest
            - stylelint
            - yarn or npm audit (optionally, CI or before remote push)
        - Backend (overcommit): 
            - rubocop
            - fasterer
            - reek
            - bundle-audit (optionally, CI or before remote push)
            - rails_best_practices
            - brakeman
- Commit messages should be clear and concise
    - Use the description field if there is a lot to record
    - It is a good thing to use the task or issue # in the commit message
- Write tests that cover your lines of code and the possible scenarios, likewise, write tests for bugs you fix
    - Read http://betterspecs.org/
    - Write unit tests for public methods only
    - UI tests are mandatory for UI changes (non-hotfixes)
    - API tests are compulsory for backend related changes unless a comprehensive unit test covers it.
