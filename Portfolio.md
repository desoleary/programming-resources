###### Experience as a Lead Developer

- Architect and major contributor to the truLEADS application which went from an unmaintained application into an application that secured two multi-million dollar deals.
- Made many decisive and informed key technical decisions without of which would have surely doomed the project to failure.
    - Many of these decisions were formed within the first month, this was important as we were up against pretty intense deadlines.
    - I bought into the original vision of the product from the beginning and was relentless in its pursuit
    - Expended much effort into convincing the leadership and development team that my proposals would lead to success, thankfully this turned out to be true and through many self-sacrifices and collaboration with a tight nit team.
    - Learnt so much throughout that looking back at it now, I am amazed what we as a team achieved in such a short space of time.
- Onboarded and mentored developers throughout my tenure via practical pairing sessions
    - I work best with passionate hard-working developers that are simply willing to learn, collaborate and importantly buy into the vision of the company/product. 
    - Helped grow the team from 3 developers that delivered the initial MVP product into an ever expanding team of 10+
    - I am proud of my contribution in helping mature the team into a motivated and self-sufficient group of developers.
    - Always available to lend a hand, be it build issues, investigate bugs or design questions
    - Supported the team through code reviews that included tips, examples and links to any relevant resources

###### Flexibility in wearing multiple hats

-   I wore many hats throughout including architecture, development, UX design, dev ops and leadership. I feel my technical experience provides an excellent match for your platform, combined with my ability to learn new technologies and related best practices which help me get off the blocks running.

###### Promote healthy work environment
- This is especially to important to me, I like to get to know each individual in the pursuit of a good working relationship so they feel comfortable asking me anything and know that I will do my best to point them in the right direction. 
- Life is difficult enough without the stress of being overworked which leads to burn out; It's so important at the start to have an ethos that promotes well being and respect for one another. 

###### The ability to be clear and persuasive in writing and in person

- This was an absolute requirement in my role as Senior Architect with Hubstaff
    - Interacted almost daily with a highly skilled architect and CTO in order to produce requirement documents that were used to streamline the development process
        - UX workflow diagrams (Adobe XD is my favourite tool)
        - Competitor analysis
        - Review impact to existing implementation and came up with a list of acceptance criteria to help minimize the risk of major bugs introduced
        - Lead two project simultaneously which were implemented primarily using my designs
- Have continually improved on this and enlist the help from Grammarly from time to time.
- Being very technical I continue to work on my communication skills which has improved tremendously in the last 5 or 6 years.
