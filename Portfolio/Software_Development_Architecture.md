# Software Development Architect

- Passionate Software Architect/Developer Craftsman
- High energy and an avid learner always looking for best practices
- Extremely Hard working
- Fully aware that while I know a lot there is always much more to learn and improve upon
- Always stand up for the team as a whole and believe that the team dynamic is of utmost importance
- Do not over architect
  - Things change once you start implementing and learn more through more detailed research
  - Break things down into smaller pieces and provide detailed todo list where possible
  - Be careful with attempting to make decision that can be left for later as you will find that you will be better placed to make better judgements with you and the team future self
- Only decide on what you know now and leave the unknown for later when you have more knowledge
- Promote vertical slices of work
  - Needs to include detailed wire frames collaborated with the whole team and not just the PO (product owner)
  - Development team needs to take ownership of the product and should be given responsibility and feel empowered if they want to grasp the opportunity
  - Fail fast and get feedback from your customers early to make sure we are going in the right direction and make them realize we here to listen and consider their feedback


## Communicability
  - Confident in coming up with solutions to hard problems
  - I and try to come into conversations in good faith and feel it is important for everyone to
  have their say and have often found that hard conversations to come out with solutions which turn out to beneficial to all involved.
  - Backup my ideas with research without trying to solution everything off the cuff and prefer
    to talk things out with the team to reach consensus
  - I undertake responsibility to ensure
  - Lead by example from a technical and personal point of view
    - Each stack has been developed looking at best practice out there and coming up with even solutions
    exemplified esp. React & Redux + Rematch

## Learnt the following technologies
   - Each library and framework chosen has been fully researched and tried out practically
     - I have at times worked with a framework for example a heiraracal

   - Laravel (PHP equivalent to Ruby on Rails)
     - Gives me even better perspectives on what works well
